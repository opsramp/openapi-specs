summary: Create alert on a resource
description: |-
  Creates a single alert on a resource.

  ##### Notes
  - A list of event IDs is generated when alerts are created. This list is valid for 30 days.
  - Use the event IDs to search and retrieve alert details.

  Creation of a new resource depends on the following:

  - A new resource is created and new device group, service group, and location are assigned.
  - A new resource is created and existing device group, service group, and location are assigned.
  - An already existing resource cannot be assigned to a new or existing Device Group, Service Group and Location.
