  3. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
  4. In Configuration, click Status Flows.
  5. Check the status flow for the entity Problems.

  Step 2: Provide the reason for changing the status.
  1. Click Setup.
  2. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
  3. In Configuration, click Status Change Reasons and then click Add.
  4. Select the scope, client, request type and entity status as Closed, provide the reason and then click Submit.

  Step 3: Enable the option to provide reason for closing a problem.

  ##### Notes
  - Use the get problem API to check if status Closed and reasons to provide for Close are enabled. If under the field allowedStatus if name: Closed and reasonsEnabled: true, this indicates reasons should be provided for closing a problem.
  - Use the get status change reasons API to provide the reasons to Close. The reasons configured in status: Closed are accepted, but a new provided reason would result in an error.
  - Date format must be yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ (GMT).
