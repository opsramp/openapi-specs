  summary: Close service request
  description: |-
    This endpoint is used to close a service request.

    Follow the steps before closing a service request:

    Step 1: Check the status flow transition for Closed.
    1. Login to OpsRamp.
    2. Click Setup.
    3. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
    4. In Configuration, click Status Flows.
    5. Check the status flow for the entity Service Request.
    6. Check the transition of the status Closed. If Closed is available this indicates the service request can be closed; otherwise, the service request cannot be closed.

    Step 2: Provide the reason for changing the status.
    1. Click Setup.
    2. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
    3. In Configuration, click Status Change Reasons and then click Add.
    4. Select the scope, client, request type and entity status as Closed, provide the reason and then click Submit.

    Step 3: Enable the option to provide reason for closing a service request.
    >This is normally an optional step. However, this step is required to provide a reason for closing the service request.
    1. Click Setup.
    2. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
    3. In Configuration, click Settings.
    4. Select client and then click Customize.
    5. In Problem Settings section, select option Enable reasons to change status Close and then click Save.

    >## Notes
    >- Use the get service request API to check if status Closed and reasons to provide for Close are enabled. If under the field allowedStatus if name: Closed and reasonsEnabled: true, this indicates reasons should be provided for closing a service request.
    >- Use the get status change reasons API to provide the reasons to Close. The reasons configured in status: Closed are accepted, but a new provided reason would result in an error.
    >- Date format must be yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ (GMT).
