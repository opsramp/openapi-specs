  summary: Close incident
  description: |-
    This endpoint is used to close an incident.

    Follow the steps before closing an incident:

    Step 1: Check the status flow transition for Closed.
    1. Login to OpsRamp.
    2. Click Setup.
    3. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
    4. In Configuration, click Status Flows.
    5. Check the status flow for the entity Incidents.
    6. Check the transition of the status Closed. If Closed is available this indicates the incident can be closed; otherwise, the incident cannot be closed.

    Step 2: Provide the reason for changing the status.
    1. Click Setup.
    2. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
    3. In Configuration, click Status Change Reasons and then click Add.
    4. Select the scope, client, request type and entity status as Closed, provide the reason and then click Submit.

    Step 3: Enable the option to provide reason for closing an incident.
    >This is normally an optional step. However, this step is required to provide a reason for closing the incident.
    1. Click Setup.
    2. On the left-hand side panel, click Service Desk.
    3. In Configuration, click Settings.
    4. Select client and then click Customize.
    5. In Incident Request section, select option Enable reasons to change status Close and then click Save.

    >## Notes
    >- Use the get incident API to check if status Closed and reasons to provide for Close are enabled. If under the field allowedStatus if name: Closed and reasonsEnabled: true, this indicates reasons should be provided for closing an incident.
    >- Use the get status change reasons API to provide the reasons to Close. The reasons configured in status: Closed are accepted, but a new provided reason would result in an error.
    >- Date format must be yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ (GMT).
