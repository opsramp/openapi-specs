    Deletes a service group.

    ##### Notes
    - Deleting a service group removes the service group name and its details.
    - Deleting a parent service group also deletes the child entities (resources or service groups).
    - Resources or Services under the deleted service group are retained and are available in the OpsRamp infrastructure page.
